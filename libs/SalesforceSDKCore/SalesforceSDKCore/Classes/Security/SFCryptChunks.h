 *  It does not allocate any memory to perform the encryption / decryption,
 *  the size of memory used (by SFCryptChunks) is O(1) regardless of the input / output data size.
 *  
 *  Basic usage is:
 *      1. Create an instance giving it a key and setting a delegate to consume results;
 *      2. Pass encrypted / decrypted data in as many times needed;
 *      3. Handle results via the delegate methods as you pass data in;
 *      4. When done passing data in, call the finalize crypt method (this is a very important step).
